## Demo

If you wish to work on your element in isolation, we recommend that you use Polyserve to keep your element's bower dependencies in line. You can install it via:

```
npm install -g polyserve
```
And you can run it via:
```
polyserve
```
Once running, you can preview your element at http://localhost:8080/components/font-kune-polymer-icons/, where `font-kune-polymer-icons` is the name of the directory containing it.
